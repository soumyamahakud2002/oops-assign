        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects and classes. It provides a way to design and organize code that simulates real-world objects and systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of an object. It is a collection of variables and methods that are used to create objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class, and has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions). Objects are the actual entities that are created from the class blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the implementation details. Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, making it harder for other parts of the program to access or modify them directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder methods, also known as special methods or magic methods, are methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __init__, __str__, etc.). They are used to define the behavior of objects and are typically called automatically by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class (the subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and behavior of an existing class (the superclass or base class). The subclass can also add new properties and behavior or override the ones inherited from the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used. This can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using classes and objects, and by making data and methods private (using a single underscore prefix) or protected (using a double underscore prefix).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor is a special method in Python that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and is typically defined using the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than the instance, and are used to define alternative constructors or other class-level behavior. Static methods are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance, and are used to define utility functions that don't depend on the instance state.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Method overloading is a feature in some programming languages that allows multiple methods with the same name to be defined, as long as they have different parameter lists. Python does not support method overloading in the classical sense, but it can be achieved using optional arguments or the *args syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Method overriding is a feature in OOP where a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "A property decorator is a way to customize access to instance data in Python. It allows you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, which can be used to implement validation, logging, or other behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows for more flexibility and generic code, making it easier to write programs that can work with different types of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is intended to be inherited by other classes. It can define abstract methods, which are methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "The advantages of OOP include code reusability, modularity, and ease of maintenance, as well as improved readability and understandability of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class, while an instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "The __str__ method is used to provide a human-readable representation of an object, while the __repr__ method is used to provide a more formal representation of an object that can be used for debugging or logging.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "The super() function in Python is used to access the methods and properties of a parent class (also known as a superclass) from a child class (also known as a subclass). It allows you to override methods in the parent class while still calling the original method.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python is a special method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to release any resources that the object is holding onto, such as file handles or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "@staticmethod and @classmethod are both decorators in Python that can be used to define methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. The main difference between the two is that @classmethod takes the class as an argument, while @staticmethod does not.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows you to define methods in a parent class that can be overridden by child classes. This allows you to write code that can work with different types of objects, without having to know the specific type of object at compile time.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. This can make the code more readable and easier to write.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an object to be called like a function. This can be useful for creating objects that need to be called multiple times, or for creating objects that need to be used as functions."
